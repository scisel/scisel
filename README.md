### Hi there üëã
My name is ≈Åukasz ≈öcise≈Ç, and I am determined to become a professional software tester.

Below you will find my portfolio.

### Project Name:
Live Manual Testing Project: Online Software Testing Practice

### Project Summary:
I was put in a virtual corporate environment and I tested a demo banking website. I created and executed test cases and then compared them with sample test cases created by Guru99 experts. I had access to Sofware Requirements Specification.

### Reference:
Guru99‚Äôs virtual experience program.

### Completion Time:
The project lasted for 13 days. I received one e-mail every 24 hours. Each e-mail contained tutorials, and tasks to complete.

### What I have learned:
- what the actual testing process looks like in the corporate environment,
- what does a document look like that describes what the software will do and how it is expected to perform,
- what are unit tests, integration tests, and system tests
- how to create test cases,
- how to execute test cases,
- how to test modules of application,
- how to report bugs.

### What I have created:
- backlog [Google Sheets document here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cHQy8ifQJJT14hLBdCxtcXK6ndZrK823kww7ty21m38/edit#gid=0)
